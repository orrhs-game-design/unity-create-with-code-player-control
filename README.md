# Unity Create with Code - Player Control Solution

This repository houses an extended solution to Unity's "Create with Code" Project 1, focusing on Player Control. It's designed as both a teaching tool and a reference point to aid students in understanding the fundamentals of player movement and interaction within the Unity engine.

## Project Overview

The original project from Unity's curriculum introduces the basics of player control and interaction within a 3D game environment. This repository builds upon that foundation with custom enhancements to provide a more in-depth learning experience.

## Custom Enhancements

- **Improved Movement Mechanics:** Fine-tuned player movement for a smoother gameplay experience.
- **Additional Interactions:** New player interactions to showcase the versatility of Unity's physics engine.
- **Code Comments:** Extensive comments explaining the functionality and purpose of code blocks to facilitate understanding.

## Usage

This project is intended for educational purposes. Students are encouraged to review the code, understand the mechanics, and use this as a starting point for their own experimentation and learning.

### For Students

- **Study the Code:** Go through the scripts to understand how player control is implemented.
- **Experiment:** Make changes and see how they affect the game. Don't be afraid to break things; it's all part of the learning process.
- **Ask Questions:** If something is unclear, use it as an opportunity to seek answers and deepen your understanding.

### For Educators

- **Demonstration:** Use the project as a live demo to walk through coding concepts and Unity's features.
- **Assignment Basis:** Encourage students to use this repository as a reference for assignments or further exploration into Unity.
